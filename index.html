<h2> Research </h2>
<p><b> Intro</b> </p>
<p>
In 2003, The Hubble Space Telescope observed a dark patch of sky the size of a grain of sand. The image revealed over 10,000 galaxies. Each galaxy had a unique color, shape and size, for reasons we do not yet understand. Galaxy evolution occurs over billions of years, across the largest distance scales in
the universe. Objects known as clusters of galaxies provide excellent laboratories to test competing theories, as they contain high concentrations and diverse populations of galaxies. We take this ideal sample a step further by examining a system in which two clusters have collided, catalyzing the processes its galaxies undergo in a lifetime.

<!-- 
We examine the effects of an impending cluster merger on galaxies in the large-scale structure (LSS) RX J0910 at z =1.105. Using multiwavelength data, including 102 spectral members drawn from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey and precise photometric redshifts, we calculate star formation rates and map the specific star formation rate density of the LSS galaxies. These analyses along with an investigation of the colour–magnitude properties of LSS galaxies indicate lower levels of star formation activity in the region between the merging clusters relative to the outskirts of the system. We suggest that gravitational tidal forces due to the potential of the merging haloes may be the physical mechanism responsible for the observed suppression of star formation in galaxies caught between the merging clusters.

The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 834, Issue 2, article id. 205, 21 pp. (2017).
<!-- 
We investigate star formation in DLSCL J0916.2+2953, a dissociative merger of two clusters at z = 0.53 that has progressed {1.1}-0.4+1.3 Gyr since the first pass-through. We attempt to reveal the effects a collision may have had on the evolution of the cluster galaxies by tracing their star formation history. We probe current and recent activity to identify a possible star formation event at the time of the merger, using EW({{H}}δ ), EW([{{O}} {{II}}]), and {D}n(4000) measured from the composite spectra of 64 cluster and 153 coeval field galaxies. We supplement Keck DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph spectra with DLS and Hubble Space Telescope imaging, to determine the color, stellar mass, and morphology of each galaxy. We also conduct a comprehensive study of the populations in this complex structure. Spectral results indicate the average cluster and cluster red sequence galaxies experienced no enhanced star formation relative to the surrounding field during the merger, ruling out a predominantly merger-quenched population. We find that the average blue galaxy in the North cluster is currently active, and that the South cluster is currently post-starburst, having undergone a recent star formation event. Although the North activity could be latent or long-term merger effects, a young blue stellar population and irregular geometry suggest the cluster was still forming prior the collision. Even though the South activity coincides with the time of the merger, the blue early-type population could be a result of secular cluster processes. The evidence suggests that the dearth or surfeit of activity is indiscernible from normal cluster galaxy evolution.

  <dd>Code sample using mplD3 to make useful diagrams so you can rollover a point on a plot to see other features of that object stored in the dataframe (in my case, a galaxy on a color-magnitude plot). I also included a point-in-poly function I wrote that can be used to take an arbitrary number of N sided polygons (directly from DS9 contour file) and classify whether points in a data set are inside or outside of the shape. Outputs Pandas Groupby pickle that can be applied to do many things, as seen in my Jupyter notebooks and cluster_funct file of functions. </dd>
